Terrorism threatens world stability, Awqaf
In a statement, Awqaf's Chairman, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, said that HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, feels the pain of peoples and nations ravaged by the waves of terrorism and the legacy of violence and destruction. This stands in contrast to all values of divine religions and the dignity of human beings, he said, adding that HH Sheikh Khalifa seeks at every opportunity and international venue to counter sources of terrorism and mitigate its scourge through practical and urgent solutions.
Dr al Kaabi highlighted here the immediate humanitarian relief aid HH Sheikh Khalifa continuously orders to assist those afflicted by such phenomena as terrorism prevailing in many trouble spots around the globe.
Dr al Kaabi added that as the UAE, leaders and people, condemns every form of terrorism, it has always called for international cooperation to address its doctrinal, partisan and sectarian causes and religious terrorism. UAE is also asking for cooperation to dry up terrorism's roots through the enactment of an international system based on solidarity and coordination. The aim is to alleviate the impact of poverty, diseases, ignorance, religious or ethnic intolerance and offer alternative initiatives and comprehensive projects to guide the societies in stress away from resorting to violence, terrorism and extremism.
"More than anywhere else, the Arab and Muslim world has indeed suffered from waves of extremism and terrorism, which distorted the tolerance of Islam and destroyed many Muslim peoples' lives. [From this perspective], the UAE's decisions have always been a wise approach, one that reflects a sense of international responsibility towards peace, stability, civilisation and tolerance, which have been hijacked by the terrorist groups in disregard of social and human peace and scientific cooperation in this era of smart technology and the open space for all humans," said Dr al Kaabi.
Finally, he extended his sincere gratitude to the UAE leadership for their keen interest in the welfare of the nation and citizens and their kind initiatives of issuing legislations that cope with new developments and are also of pre-emptive nature.

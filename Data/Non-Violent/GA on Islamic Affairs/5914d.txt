The UAE yesterday overflowed with worshipers who observed the blessed Laylatul Qadr with prayers or reciting of the Holy Quran. They were praying to Allah the Almighty to accept their prayers in the holy month.
Awqaf was keen on reminding Muslims of this blessed night and its virtues by means of hortatory lessons given after Asr prayers yesterday. During these lessons, the imams urged worshipers to observe this blessed night, which is better than 1,000 months of worship.
Awqaf also ensured that all mosques were ready to receive worshipers who came to revive this night, stressing that reviving Laylatul Qadr would render them more hopeful that Allah the Almighty would answer their supplications.
During the "Dua Al Qunoot", worshipers prayed to Allah to protect the UAE government and people and continue blessing it with safety and security and to grant success and continued health to HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, the Rulers of the Emirates and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince. They also prayed to Allah, the Most Gracious, preserve President Khalifa from all evil and grant him health and well-beingto have mercy on late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and his fellow Rulers of the Emirates who passed away.
